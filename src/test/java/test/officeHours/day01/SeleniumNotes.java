##############################
	API - libraries with classes and methods that we use to talk to another program

 	Selenium WebDriver API (Application Programing Interface) - used to automate web browser
 	We use Selenium WebDriver to develop test automation scripts for web based applications

 	web based application - the one that you see in the browser, once you enter some URL.

 	Where is your selenium? It's a maven dependency:

 		 <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
            <version>3.141.59</version>
        </dependency>

    Maven will download library and add it to your project.

Everything starts from webdriver object:

 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver() ---> will work with Chrome browser

 WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver() ---> will work with Firefox browser

 WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver() ---> will work with Safari browser

driver - it's a webdriver object. Via this object, we send commands to the browser.

WebDriver - it's an interface, that is implemented by RemoteWebDriver class ---> RemoteWebDriver parent class for:

	- ChromeDriver
	- EdgeDriver
	- SafariDriver
	- FirefoxDriver

We created webdriver object. Is it enough?

- no, we need to add browser driver! Browser driver - middleman, between your code and Browser.

WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

To setup manually:
1. Go to google, find driver for your browser. For instance: google chrome - chromedriver, firefox - geckodriver.
	https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

for mac: chromedriver
for windows: chromedriver.exe

To setup before object instantiation:
	System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver",System.getProperty("user.dir")+"/Drivers/chromedriver");

Why do you need to know this?

- because not every company webdriver is allowed to use.
- also, it has issues with old OS versions, sometimes it cannot pull webdriver from the Internet.


	driver.get("http://google.com") - to open some page. This is a very first method to use in every test


If we opened browser, then we need to close it at the end:

	driver.close() - to close current tab/window. If it's the only one windows, it will also shutdown browser.

	driver.quit()  - to close all opened by webdriver windows, make session null.


driver.navigate().back() -- to navigate to previous website in the history
driver.navigate().forward() -- to navigate to forward website in the history. can be called after back()
driver.navigate().refresh() -- reload current window
driver.navigate().to() -- same as driver.get()

every window has a title, to read it use getTitle()

page title can help you to jump in between windows


WebElement - interface, that is used to wrap some HTML element and represent it as java object.

<input type="text" id="field">

WebElement element 		  = driver.findElement(By.id("field"))

List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));

list ---> [element1, element2, ....]

elements.get(0)----> element1

findElement != findElements

How do we find elements? Based on locator.

we have 8 locators: id, name, tagName, className, cssSelector, xpath, linkText, partialLinkText

The best way to allocate element - id, since it's always unique.

- if id tend to change, use cssSelector or xpath.


<input type="text" id="field">      		By.id("field")

<input type="text" name="field">    		By.name("field")

<input type="text" class="field">   		By.className("field")

<input type="text">  						By.tagName("input")

<a href="http://google.com">Google page</a> By.linkText("Google page")

<a href="http://google.com">Google page</a> By.partialLinkText("Google")



linkText/partialLinkText work only with elements that have tag name <a>

a - hyperlink, and visible text of hyperlink can be used to find that element. Visible text always located in between opening and closing tags: <a>TEXT</a>


XPath - XML path, that was originally created for XML documents. XML and HTML documents have similar structure, and that's why we can use XPath in HTML documents as well.

there are 2 types of xpath: absolute and relative

absolute xpath:
	- start with a root element
	- you cannot skip any level, you must go from parent to child element.

	/html/body/div/div[2]/input

not commonly used in test automation.


relative xpath:
	- it can start from anywhere in the document


	//tagName

	//tagName[@attribute='value']

	//tagName[@attribute='value' and @attribute='value'] - locator with 2 attributes

	//tagName[@attribute='value' or @attribute='value']  - locator with either or attributes

instead of tagName, you can specify * - to match any tag name

what makes xpath special from other locators, is that you can find element based on text:

	//tagName[text()='Some text'] or //tagName[.='Some text']

another advantage is that you can go to parent element:

	/..

For example:

	//*[text()='Sign in securely']/..


you can find element by partial text/attribute value:

	//*[contains(text(),'Some text')]

	//*[contains(text(),'Sign in secu')]


	//*[contains(@attibute,'Value')]

How to handle dynamic element?

	by using xpath, find stable parent element and based on that point "dynamic" child
	use xpath with contains

dynamic element - web element that has inconsistent attributes.

Also, you can use siblings to find elements:

<div class="box-small">
	<label>First name</label>
	<input type="text" name="first_name">
</div>

label and input elements are siblings. div element - is their parent.

//label[text()='Black']/preceding-sibling::input

/\
|| preceding


|| following
\/

//input[@id='black']/following-sibling::label


css selector (don't forget that there is no / or //)

tagName[attribute='value']

# - means ID

. - class name

> direct child

* you cannot find element based text


tagName[attribute*='partial value'] - like contains() in xpath

^ - caret sign
~ - tilde
| - pipe

tagName[attribute^='val'] - like in xpath starts-with()

JUnit - the most popular unit testing framework for Java.
TestNG - was created as improved alternative for JUnit.
Both of them, targeting unit testing.
unit -> integration -> system -> UAT
unit testing - targeting smallest functional piece of application, which is a method.
@Test
public void test(){
    Assert.assertEqauls("apple", "apple");
}
per unit test, there should be only one assertion. Assertion helps to determine test status:
In TestNG, there are 2 types of assertions: hard and soft.
hard - stops test execution in case of failure
soft - doesn't stop until assertAll() method invocation.
Assert.assert.... - hard assertions
SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert()
softAssert.assert....
softAssert.assert....
softAssert.assert....
softAssert.assertAll() - call at the end
